# Test for Operations Assistant

**1. Translate part of JD (Operations Assistant)**

Here is part of the job description for Operations Assistant position you are applying for, translate the following into Chinese: 

We’re not only nice people, we do very interesting work:

We do sh*t that matters, working on our own stuff (like devo.ps) and building products for folks you may have heard of like the World Bank or the UN, things like leveraging Open Data to visualize poverty and education, or designing election platforms (not kidding).

We spend lots of time experimenting with new things. Most of us are dabbling in 2 or 3 fields and we love it when folks decide to learn new stuff (on company time obviously).

We’re transparent about virtually anything and let people assume the role they feel comfortable with. If you feel like you can do a better job by taking over something, it’s most likely people will be happy to let you try.

We’re distributed, with folks in Berlin, Shanghai, and the US. You’ll get a chance to visit the main office in China.

We take care of our team. You'll be provided with a MacBook, an Ergonomic chair or a fitness ball (whichever floats your boat), flexible working hours (and no overtime), paid personal leave, snacks, foosball competitions, WiiU play time, weekly team lunches, and team-building events.`

**2. Budget for New Employee Tote Bag**

We want to be better at welcoming our new Wiredcraft Colleagues, because we are awesome and they are awesome.
Here are our ideas of what should be included in the on-boarding tote. 

1. The tote with a cool design like TOA
2. Moleskine embossed with WCL 
3. WCL pens
4. Lanyards
5. Cup/Mug
6. Metro Card with 200RMB
7. T-shirt/ hoodie
8. Chinese adapter (for foreigners)
9. Face mask for air pollution (hehe)
10. Macbook air if they want (ask what software they want and have it downloaded and ready for them when they arrive
11. Discount card/gift card to ikea 
12. Maybe some sort of tech gadget that might be cool to have (sorry we are a little dumb with this we will ask the developers)
13. Stickers

Can you give the budget for these stuff or add some things you think will be interesting? But if you think some of the things are not necessary or cost too much, you don't have to take into account into the budget, but need to tell why you think it is unnecessary.
